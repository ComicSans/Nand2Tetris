Nand2Tetris
===========

This repository holds my solutions to the individual chapters of the computer science course [NAND to Tetris][1].
Its intended for personal source control and backup but if YOU are interested in this stuff I recommend checking out the 
[Nand2Tetris in a nutshell (10 minutes)][2] video.

To visualize my more advanced chips I use [Logisim][3] so you might want to check it out as well
